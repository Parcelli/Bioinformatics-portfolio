# Antibiotic Resistance detection using Galaxy
## Summary
Misuse of antibiotics for Human disease treatment, as well as for various agricultural purposes, has resulted in the evolution of multi-drug resistant (MDR) pathogenic bacteria.Antimicrobial resistance is a dire problem in Kenya.Some known bacteria pathogen classified as either critical or high priority pathogens by WHO include : 

* Pseudomonas aeruginosa, carbapenem-resistant
* Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant, vancomycin-intermediate and resistant
* Helicobacter pylori, clarithromycin-resistant
* Salmonellae, fluoroquinolone-resistant
* Neisseria gonorrhoeae, cephalosporin-resistant, fluoroquinolone-resistant

The advent of long read sequencers like Oxford nanopore presents a new possibility for quick detection  and characterization of AMR.

This workflow is presented in Smörgåsbord 2023 (Free online galaxy training conducted by Galaxy team) Antibiotic resistance tutorial. Galaxy is a web-based platform for reproducible computational analysis.

I present here the bioinformatics analysis pipeline learnt from the tutorial for detection of[Antibiotic resistance](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/metagenomics/tutorials/plasmid-metagenomics-nanopore/tutorial.html).
