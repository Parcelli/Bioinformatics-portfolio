* Date
* Location
* Summary

## Project 04
### Genome assembly and annotation
* Date : Ongoing
* Location: International Centre for Insect Physiology and Ecology
* Summary

The project involves genome annotation and assembly of Stomoxys Indica genome. 
Stomoxyine flies (Diptera: Muscidae) are economically important animal pests; males and females are blood-sucking. 
They irritate the area of the bite since their saliva contains no anaesthetics, making their bites more painful and a nuisance to animals and sometimes humans. 
Stomoxys species include Stomoxys calcitrans,Stomoxys sitiens, Stomoxys indica, Stomoxys bengalensis, and Stomoxys niger (African stable fly). Stomoxys calcitrans is widely studied,however,the rest remain understudied.  Whole genome sequencing was recently done in icipe for Stomoxys indica.
The projects objective is to perform de novo assembly of S. Indica. Find the project report [here](https://github.com/mbbu/Stomoxys_Indica_Assembly/blob/main/assembly_pipeline.md)
