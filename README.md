# Bioinformatics-portfolio
Welcome to my bioinformatics portfolio,where I am excited to share some of the projects I have worked on as part of internship,job and self-learning.

## Project 01
### Metagenomics project
* Date : Jun - Sept 2021
* Location: icipe
### Summary
Fungi and Bees have shown a symbiotic relationship.Fungi protect the bees from microbial attacks.However some fungal species cause fatal diseases in bees leading to decline in bee population.
The study aimed to identify fungi species present in beehives in Zanzibar and to compare the performance of two databases in taxonomic classification.

## Project 02
### RNA Seq workflow automated in Galaxy
* Date: Aug - Dec 2022
* Location: Rayca Precision (remote)

Find the projects analysis steps and outputs at [RNASeq](https://github.com/Parcelli/Bioinformatics-portfolio/blob/gh.pages/RNASeq-Project.md).

## Project 03
### Genome assembly and annotation
* Period: Ongoing
* Location: International Centre for Insect Physiology and Ecology
* Summary

The project involves genome annotation and assembly of Stomoxys Indica genome. 
Stomoxyine flies (Diptera: Muscidae) are economically important animal pests; males and females are blood-sucking. 
They irritate the area of the bite since their saliva contains no anaesthetics, making their bites more painful and a nuisance to animals and sometimes humans. 
Stomoxys species include Stomoxys calcitrans,Stomoxys sitiens, Stomoxys indica, Stomoxys bengalensis, and Stomoxys niger (African stable fly). Stomoxys calcitrans is widely studied,however,the rest remain understudied.  Whole genome sequencing was recently done in icipe for Stomoxys indica.
The projects objective is to perform de novo assembly of S. Indica.

## Project 04
### AMR detection from Oxford Nanopore reads using Galaxy
* Date
* Location:Smorgasbord2023 Galaxy Training Network (tutorial)
